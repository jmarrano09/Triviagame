Visit the magi to learn how to find your friend

Magi: Oh sweet, silly, dumb dumb traveler. Your pet [insert pet name] is gone. You have to be a great fighter, wise and crafty in order to get your companion back.

Wizard: I have no fear!
Warrior: I have no fear.
Princess: I have no fear.
Joker: I'm a little scared.

Magi: Well aren't you brave. Well you'll be challenged, but you have enough strength of spirit, integrity and hubris to get through the challenges.
First you will wander through great wilderness to get to the [Crystal Collector]. You will use your skills of craft and magic to make the ultimate clever potion.
Once you've created your ultimate clever potion, you travel to through the swamp to the great bridge. There is the genius troll. The only way he will let you pass is if you beat him fair and square in trivia. Challenge him to a game, his pride will fail him every time.
The better you do at the [crystal collector game] the stronger your potion and the more hints you can get in the [trivia game]. If you are smart enough to pass the bridge you will be in the [Insert Villain Here]'s kingdom. I have no idea what he's doing to your sweet pet, but you better hurry. [He/She] is known to be pure evil, your pet is surely in danger. 

oh! before you go! along the way there are lions, tigers and bears. You can beat them by jumping on top of them. I give you these magic boots to guide you on your way and make your jump all the more powerful. One jump should do. Collect the coins through each journey to gain strength and health points - You may need them, it is going to be a dangerous journey. Collect the key to unlock the door to the next challenge.

**Goes through the first two levels.**

Oh no! you've reached the castle and your pet is about to be hung. Somehow challenge the [Insert Villain here] to guess what he is thinking. If you can guess the word then you can get your pet back.

You've won! congratulations, but he's getting away! Go after him.

Fight him.

You've won the game.
