# Trivia-game

- In this assignment, a Trivia game was created using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 
- This trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
- If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulates them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question will display without user input.
- If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
- On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

## Technologies Used:
